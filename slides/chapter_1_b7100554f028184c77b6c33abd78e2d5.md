## Lesson 2.1 - Relational to Flat structure

```yaml
type: "TitleSlide"
key: "6fdc89dd22"
```

`@lower_third`
name: Name Surname
title: Instructor


`@script`
For this exercise we will take separate databases and combine them into one flat database using SQL. This is the required format for Machine Learning.

## Marketing Funnel Data Structure

Here you can see the database structure of the data repositories we are interested in in this analysis. The first step in the process is the "Lead", coming from the Marketing Qualified Leads dataset.

Remember, this was a comma delimited file loaded in previously. The second step in the Marketing Funnel is making a "Deal", which is quantified and stored in the Closed Deals dataset.

The "Seller" that made the "Deal" has information associated to him in the Sellers dataset, and the "Items" sold have related information in the Order Items dataset.

## Load data into Pandas Dataframe

```yaml
type: "FullCodeSlide"
key: "66af6deb4e"
center_content: true
disable_transition: false
```

#Function to convert CSV to SQL table
def csv_to_sql(csv, sql):
    df = pd.read_csv("data/" + csv + ".csv")
    df.to_sql(sql, conn, if_exists='replace', index=False)
```{{1}}
```
# Marketing Qualified Leads
csv_to_sql('olist_marketing_qualified_leads_dataset','leads')
```{{2}}
```
# Closed Deal
csv_to_sql('olist_closed_deals_dataset','deals')

# Seller List
csv_to_sql('olist_sellers_dataset','sellers')

# Item List
csv_to_sql('olist_order_items_dataset','items')
```{{3}}


`@script`
First we will define a function to create a SQL table from a comma delimited file. We will pass the file name, assuming it is in the data folder, and also the SQL table name we will create.

The function will first create a Pandas dataframe, reading in the CSV file. Then we will use a Pandas function to create the SQLite database table from the Pandas dataframe.

The functiom is to_sql, which takes in the SQL table name we will create, the connection to the SQLite database we are creating the table in, and two behavioral parameters. The 'if_exists' parameter determines what the function will do if the table already exists in the database. In our case we will replace the existing table. The last parameter is used to determine if our table will need an index, which in our examples we will not be creating them.

So now we will be calling the function, passing in the CSV table name for the Leads first, and the name "leads" which we will use for the table name in the database.

Likewise we will call the function for the remaining three files, creating the "deals", "sellers" and "items" tables in the database.

As we begin to use these tables, pulling the information together for machine learning, we will take a closer look at the data elements.
