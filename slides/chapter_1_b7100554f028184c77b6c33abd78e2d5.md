Here you can see the database structure of the data repositories we are interested in in this analysis. The first step in the process is the "Lead", coming from the Marketing Qualified Leads dataset.

Remember, this was a comma delimited file loaded in previously. The second step in the Marketing Funnel is making a "Deal", which is quantified and stored in the Closed Deals dataset.

The "Seller" that made the "Deal" has information associated to him in the Sellers dataset, and the "Items" sold have related information in the Order Items dataset.
