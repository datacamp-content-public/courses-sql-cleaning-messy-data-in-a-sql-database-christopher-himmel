## Lesson 2.1 - Relational to Flat structure

```yaml
type: "TitleSlide"
key: "03b69ddb7c"
```

`@lower_third`
name: Name Surname
title: Instructor


`@script`
For this exercise we will take separate databases and combine them into one flat database using SQL. This is the required format for Machine Learning.

## Review Leads Table

```yaml
type: "FullCodeSlide"
key: "101db182d3"
```

`@part1`
```
pd.read_sql('SELECT * FROM leads LIMIT 5', conn)
```
{{1}}

`@script`
Now that we have loaded our data, lets take a look at the "leads" table. To do this, we will use another Pandas function, read_sql. This function returns the visual output from the SQL statement you pass in the first argument, run on the connection you pass as the second argument.

You can see here that we are running a simple select statement on the "leads" table in the database referenced by the "conn" object.

So that we don't overload the screen, we are only showing the first five rows of the table.

Note that there are four columns, the first of which is the mql_id, which is the ID of the record, which shows one Marketing Qualified Lead.

## Review Deals Table

```yaml
type: "FullCodeSlide"
key: "76138e9147"
```

`@part1`
```
pd.read_sql('SELECT * FROM deals LIMIT 5', conn)
```{{1}}

`@script`
Likewise, we will now review the "Deals" table. In the same manner, we will run the Pandas read_sql function, showing the first five rows of the "deals" table.

Note that there are many more columns than we can show here, and we would just scroll to the right to see more of the columns.

The first column, you will notice is the mql_id, representing the Marketing Qualified Lead that this "deal" was made for. This will be used shortly to tie back to the associated "lead".

## Preview Joining Deals to Leads

```yaml
type: "FullCodeSlide"
key: "65bcefff46"
```

`@part1`
```
pd.read_sql('SELECT * FROM                         \
                 leads LEFT JOIN                   \
                 deals                             \
                     ON leads.mql_id = deals.mql_id\
             LIMIT 5', conn)
```{{1}}

`@script`
The way we are going to connect the two tables together with the mql_id is with a JOIN. In specific, it will be with a LEFT JOIN. This means every record in the file before the JOIN keyword will be included. If a record of the file to the right of the JOIN keyword meets the join criteria, it will be included as well at the end of the first file records. The join criteria follows the ON keyword.

In our example, we want all of the "leads", adding on the "deals" if one has a matching mql_id. In our results, you can see that only lead of the first five records had a matching deal. The rest of the records have null values for the deal columns.

## Create JOINed Table

```yaml

```

`@part1`
```
conn.execute('DROP TABLE IF EXISTS funnel1')

sql_cmd = 'CREATE TABLE funnel1 AS                   \
               SELECT * FROM                         \
                   leads LEFT JOIN                   \
                   deals                             \
                       ON leads.mql_id = deals.mql_id'
conn.execute(sql_cmd)

pd.read_sql('SELECT * FROM funnel1 LIMIT 5', conn)
