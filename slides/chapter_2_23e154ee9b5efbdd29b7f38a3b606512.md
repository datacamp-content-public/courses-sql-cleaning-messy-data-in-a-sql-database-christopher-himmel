## Lesson 2.1 - Relational to Flat structure

```yaml
type: "TitleSlide"
key: "03b69ddb7c"
```

`@lower_third`
name: Name Surname
title: Instructor


`@script`
For this exercise we will take separate databases and combine them into one flat database using SQL. This is the required format for Machine Learning.

## Review Leads Table

```yaml
type: "FullCodeSlide"
key: "101db182d3"
```

`@part1`
```
pd.read_sql('SELECT * FROM leads LIMIT 5', conn)
```
{{1}}

{{2}}


`@script`
Now that we have loaded our data, lets take a look at the "leads" table. To do this, we will use another Pandas function, read_sql. This function returns the visual output from the SQL statement you pass in the first argument, run on the connection you pass as the second argument.

You can see here that we are running a simple select statement on the "leads" table in the database referenced by the "conn" object.

So that we don't overload the screen, we are only showing the first five rows of the table.

Note that there are four columns, the first of which is the mql_id, which is the ID of the record, which shows one Marketing Qualified Lead.

## Review Deals Table

```yaml
type: "FullCodeSlide"
key: "76138e9147"
```

`@part1`
```
pd.read_sql('SELECT * FROM deals LIMIT 5', conn)
```{{1}}

{{2}}


`@script`
Likewise, we will now review the "Deals" table. In the same manner, we will run the Pandas read_sql function, showing the first five rows of the "deals" table.

Note that there are many more columns than we can show here, and we would just scroll to the right to see more of the columns.

The first column, you will notice is the mql_id, representing the Marketing Qualified Lead that this "deal" was made for. This will be used shortly to tie back to the associated "lead".

## Preview Joining Deals to Leads

```yaml
type: "FullCodeSlide"
key: "65bcefff46"
```

`@part1`
```
pd.read_sql('SELECT * FROM                         \
                 leads LEFT JOIN                   \
                 deals                             \
                     ON leads.mql_id = deals.mql_id\
             LIMIT 5', conn)
```{{1}}

{{2}}


`@script`
The way we are going to connect the two tables together with the mql_id is with a JOIN. In specific, it will be with a LEFT JOIN. This means every record in the file before the JOIN keyword will be included. If a record of the file to the right of the JOIN keyword meets the join criteria, it will be included as well at the end of the first file records. The join criteria follows the ON keyword.

In our example, we want all of the "leads", adding on the "deals" if one has a matching mql_id. In our results, you can see that only lead of the first five records had a matching deal. The rest of the records have null values for the deal columns.

## Create JOINed Table

```yaml
type: "FullCodeSlide"
key: "7d5d749a63"
```

`@part1`
```
conn.execute('DROP TABLE IF EXISTS funnel1')

sql_cmd = 'CREATE TABLE funnel1 AS                   \
               SELECT * FROM                         \
                   leads LEFT JOIN                   \
                   deals                             \
                       ON leads.mql_id = deals.mql_id'
conn.execute(sql_cmd)

pd.read_sql('SELECT * FROM funnel1 LIMIT 5', conn)
```{{1}}
![](https://assets.datacamp.com/production/repositories/4220/datasets/71d5f5ee031010f0bf60d437be06b06f8271f9bd/Capture4.PNG)
{{2}}


`@script`
The next step, once we are sure the at the preview is accurate, is the actually create a table with the results. Since the new table may already exist, first we will DROP the table to remove it from the database.

Then we will do a CREATE TABLE command, adding the AS keyword, followed by exactly what we previewed. Once we run the command, the new table is created.

Then we can preview the resulting table with a simple SELECT command, showing the first five rows. Note that the first four columns are from the "leads" table, and then starts the "deals" table. Also, note that since mql_id is in both tables, ".1" was added to the name to make the second one have a unique name, even though it contains the same information.

## Preview Joining Sellers

```yaml
type: "FullCodeSlide"
key: "a8f02fe74a"
```

`@part1`
```
pd.read_sql('SELECT * FROM                                   \
                 funnel1 LEFT JOIN                           \
                 sellers                                     \
                     ON funnel1.seller_id = sellers.seller_id\
             LIMIT 5', conn)

{{2}}


`@script`
In exactly the same manner, we preview adding the "sellers" table in, matching on seller_id. The number of columns has grown to 22.

## Create JOINed Table

```yaml

```

`@part1`
```
conn.execute('DROP TABLE IF EXISTS funnel2')

sql_cmd = 'CREATE TABLE funnel2 AS                             \
               SELECT * FROM                                   \
                   funnel1 LEFT JOIN                           \
                   sellers                                     \
                       ON funnel1.seller_id = sellers.seller_id'
conn.execute(sql_cmd)

pd.read_sql('SELECT * FROM funnel2 LIMIT 5', conn)
```{{1}}

{{2}}


`@script`
Here we actually add the table with the new columns in exactly the same manner.

## Preview Joining Items

```yaml
type: "FullCodeSlide"
key: "2e3dc70a4a"
```

`@part1`
```
pd.read_sql('SELECT * FROM                                 \
                 funnel2 LEFT JOIN                         \
                 items                                     \
                     ON funnel2.seller_id = items.seller_id\
             LIMIT 5', conn)
```{{1}}

{{2}}


`@script`
Again the preview for the "items" sold by the "sellers".

Note the number of columns grew to 29.

## Create JOINed Table

```yaml
type: "FullCodeSlide"
key: "a7cfd50de1"
```

`@part1`
```
conn.execute('DROP TABLE IF EXISTS funnels')

sql_cmd = 'CREATE TABLE funnels AS                           \
               SELECT * FROM                                 \
                   funnel2 LEFT JOIN                         \
                   items                                     \
                       ON funnel2.seller_id = items.seller_id'
conn.execute(sql_cmd)

conn.execute('DROP TABLE IF EXISTS funnel1')
conn.execute('DROP TABLE IF EXISTS funnel2')

pd.read_sql('select * from funnels limit 6', conn)
```{{1}}
![](https://assets.datacamp.com/production/repositories/4220/datasets/d9833201a8f4f26441897b125670b84bc1b65167/Capture8.PNG)
{{2}}


`@script`
And the final step is to create the final table "funnels" with the item table added in.

At this point we should remove the intermediate tables we created with the DROP command.

## Let's try out some JOINs!

```yaml

`@script`
OK, time to put this into practice! Let's try out some JOINs.
